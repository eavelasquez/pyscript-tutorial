# PyScript Tutorial

This repository is a series of short [examples](https://pyscript.net/examples/) using [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/).

[PyScript](https://anaconda.cloud/pyscript-python-in-the-browser) is a system for interleaving Python in HTML. This means you can write and run Python code in HTML, call JavaScript libraries in PyScript, and do all your web development in Python.
